# Overview
Chemical Combat aims to improve potions in combat while remaining balanced and fun for Singleplayer and Multiplayer experiences. Therefore, every Solution is designed with a competitive aspect in mind.

<details>
<summary>More Info</summary>

- **Solutions** are upgraded potions that use cooldowns to stop Solution spamming while not removing the Solution from the player's inventory. This solves the inventory space problem that vanilla potions have, as the player only needs one of a specific Solution and can then use it multiple times.
- Solutions also utilize a **Drink Mode** and **Throw Mode**, enabling the player to choose whether to apply an effect to only themselves or onto other entities/players.

</details>



# Solutions
Solutions come in three categories: **Enhancement**, **Debuff**, and **Damaging**.

<details>
<summary>More Info</summary>

- **Enhancement** solutions contain effects that buff whatever they affect.
- **Debuff** solutions do the opposite and cripple what they affect.
- **Damaging** solutions are designed for pure offense and inflict Magic Damage, which ignores Physical Armor.
- **All** solutions have 1,561 uses, the same as a Diamond Sword's durability.
- **Ticks** are used as the primary measurement of time for effect durations as they are the most accurate metric built into Minecraft.

</details>
